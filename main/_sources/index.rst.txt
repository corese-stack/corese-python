`Corese`_ is a software platform implementing and extending the standards of the Semantic Web. It allows to create, manipulate, parse, serialize, query, reason, and validate RDF data. Corese is based on the W3C standards `RDF`_, `RDFS`_, `OWL RL`_, `SPARQL`_ and `SHACL`_. Corese is implemented as a set of open-source Java libraries.

**pycorese** is a Python package that provides a simple way to integrate the `corese-core`_ Java library into Python applications.

**pycorese** offers an intuitive API to interact with Corese's capabilities such as storage, SPARQL engine, RDFS and OWL reasoning, and SHACL validation.

**pycorese** unlocks the potential of Semantic Web stack for applications such as semantic data analysis, knowledge graph construction, and Machine Learning.
